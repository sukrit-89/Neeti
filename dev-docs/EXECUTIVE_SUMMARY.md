# Executive Summary

## What Neeti AI Is

Neeti AI is a technical interview platform that combines live interview collaboration with AI-assisted evaluation. It is built for recruiter-led interview sessions with evidence capture from coding behavior, communication signals, and final scoring workflows.

## Core Value

- Reduce manual interview-note overhead.
- Provide consistent evaluation artifacts.
- Keep human hiring decision authority while surfacing machine-generated evidence.

## Product Pillars

1. Real-time interview room (video + coding).
2. Session lifecycle management for recruiters and candidates.
3. Event capture and replay-ready coding telemetry.
4. AI evaluation pipeline with triggerable processing and structured output.
5. Operational deployability with Docker and managed services.

## Current Technical Position

- Backend: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy and Redis-backed patterns.
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite.
- Auth: Supabase token model with backend validation.
- Realtime: WebSocket and Redis publish/subscribe.
- Worker processing: Celery tasks for evaluation pipelines.

## Stakeholder Outcomes

### Recruiters
- Faster session setup and candidate monitoring.
- Structured post-session evaluation reports.
- Reduced reliance on ad-hoc note taking.

### Engineering Teams
- Clear API boundaries and schema-driven contracts.
- Containerized deployment options.
- Flexible AI/provider integration strategy.

### Operations
- Straightforward local and production bootstrap.
- Health endpoint visibility for dependency readiness.
- Degraded-mode behavior when dependencies are temporarily unavailable.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Dependency outages (DB/Redis/LiveKit): mitigated by health checks, degraded startup behavior, and explicit error responses.
- Auth/role misuse: mitigated by server-side role resolution and dependency checks.
- Execution abuse: mitigated by language allowlists, payload limits, and execution caps.

## Next Practical Priorities

1. Expand integration and load testing coverage for session and evaluation workflows.
2. Tighten production runbooks and alert thresholds.
3. Evolve evaluator calibration and explainability in reports.
